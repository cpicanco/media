# Picanco et al media files
Here lives an LFS (https://git-lfs.com/) repository for media files used to stimuli presentation in experimental research using [Stimulus Control SDL2](https://github.com/cpicanco/stimulus-control-sdl2/) software. Research topics includes teaching and assessment of reading skills (with and without comprehension) using an artificially constructed linguistic system (also known as constructed language or COLANG).

It contains `*.png`, `*.ttf`, `*.wav` files of the COLANG: The COLANG consists of 4 consonants, 4 vowels, and pseudowords of the CVCV type, primary emphasis at the second syllable. This system allows for the creation, through combination, of syllables (16) and words (256). The following pages illustrate the correspondence between the possible combinations..

Media inside the `docs` folder are used for only for repository documentation.

## PNG files

PNG files are photos of unusual objects with transparent background. Their filenames indicates their confection method as follows:

`2XXX` filenames indicates files that were (1) copied from the "Novel Object and Unusual Name Database (NOUN): NOUN-2-600DPI Set" (https://stimuli.mit.edu/stimulus/555) dataset, and (2) have its background removed using an online AI background remover tool (https://zyro.com/) and manually using GIMP (when using the AI tool failed). The NOUN-2 dataset have Familiarity and Name-Ability scores and is maintained by Michael Hout (New Mexico State University), Jessica Horst (University of Sussex). The `base` folder contains the 24 most novel stimuli available in the 600dpi dataset.

`3XXX` filenames indicates files that were generated by AI (https://my.visme.co/) using descriptions such as strange "assymetric object vermelho verde azul distorcido".


`cvcv` (where `c` means `consonant` and `vowels`) filenames indicates files randomily copied from the `base` folder.


## WAV files

`cvcv` filenames are text-to-speech words synthesized using Microsoft's Speech Object Library (SAPI), with the following SSML template (for the word befo):

```xml
  Result := '<speak version="1.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang="pt-BR">' +
    '<voice name="Microsoft Maria Desktop - Portuguese(Brazil)">' +
      '<prosody rate="10%">' +
        '<phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="bɛ.ˈfɔ">befo</phoneme>.'+
      '</prosody>'+
    '</voice>'+
  '</speak>';
```

During teaching, some sounds are used as differential consequences: 

`acerto` is a high pitch sound used as consequence for right responses.

`erro` is a low pitch sound used as consequence for wrong responses.


## TTF files

`Picanco_et_al.ttf`: font file in TTF format (not fully compliant).
`Picanco_et_al.sfd`: Sound Forge design file.


### Font Creation methodology

A text font (`Picanco et al.ttf`) was created to facilitate the presentation of text stimuli in the study to be replicated (Hanna et al, 2011). The font was manually crafted using FontForge (https://fontforge.org). The creation of each character in the font followed some steps. First, a base character (O), a circular shape with a "hole" was distorted:

Following the distortion, the characters were inspected, and if they bore any striking resemblance to known characters or shapes, the process was redone. Subsequently, they were vertically elongated, centered, and the horizontal spacing was uniformly reduced, maintaining the same vertical distance for all characters. Finally, minor adjustments were made to prevent overlaps between support points of character design lines.

### Instructions for installing the font on a computer and using it in text editors

To install the font on Windows, simply double-click the `Picanco et al.ttf` file and then click "Install." Afterward, the font will be listed in the font selection menu of programs such as Microsoft Word, Libre Office, etc., as `Picanco et al.`.
