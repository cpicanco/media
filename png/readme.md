Folders here contains `*.png` files confectioned with different methods. All files have their background removed using an online AI background remover [tool](https://zyro.com/), using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) manually, or both.

# `alpha_numeric_convention` folder
Example folder for drag-n-drop trials. Files inside this folder are photos organized into meaningful categories: flyes, trees, and monkeys. For more details, please, see [convention](https://github.com/cpicanco/media/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#convention-for-media-files-and-class-members-correspondence-drag-n-drop).

# `pool` folder
Files inside this folder are abstract objects and figures.

- `2XXX.png` files were copied from the "Novel Object and Unusual Name Database (NOUN): NOUN-2-600DPI Set" (https://stimuli.mit.edu/stimulus/555) dataset, and The NOUN-2 dataset have Familiarity and Name-Ability scores and is maintained by Michael Hout (New Mexico State University), Jessica Horst (University of Sussex). 

- `3XXX.png` files were generated by AI (https://my.visme.co/) using input text containing words such as "strange asymmetrical object red green blue distorted".

- `4XXX.png` files were generated by mixing `2XXX.png` files with themselves or with `meaningful` files using `The Image Mixer` (https://github.com/justinpinkney/stable-diffusion?tab=readme-ov-file#image-mixer), which is a fine tuned version, written by Justin Pinkney, of Stable Diffusion. Currently, they are dinamically and randomilly loaded as S- stimuli when required.

# `base` folder
When you create a new participant you must also create a new base media path for this participant. The `base` folder contains the 24 most novel stimuli available in the 600dpi dataset (See `pool` folder for details). These files are randomily selected and renamed with its target `cvcv` class when creating a new base media path. Hence, `cvcv.png` filenames are  are correlated with (1) `cvcv` wav files and (2)  `cvcv` text of pseudowords used throughout an experimental session.

# `meaningful` folder
Contains meaningful images.

# `markers` folder
Contains fiducial markers (aka [April Tags](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/software/pupil-capture/#markers)) to track surfaces with Pupil eye trackers when using the `Surface Tracker` plugin from `Pupil Capture` software.
